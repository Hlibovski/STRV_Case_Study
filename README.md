# STRV_Case_Study
This project explores trends in baby names using data analysis and visualization. By leveraging historical name data, I identified popular names at the national and state levels, uncovered rare names, and examined naming patterns over time. The insights help parents make informed decisions when choosing a name while also providing valuable data-driven perspectives. The project utilizes Python, SQL, and Streamlit for interactive visualization, making name trends easily accessible and engaging.

## Project files:
1. STRV_Case_Study.pptx - presentation of the insights.
2. app.py - Python code of the Streamlit app
3. database.sqlite - SQLite database with tables and views.
4. STRV_Case_Study.docx - Word file documenting the thought process, ideas and ChatGPT brainstorming.
5. STRV_Case_Study.twb - Tableau visualizations (1st approach).
6. CSV Files

## Project Problem:
I wanted to host a streamlit app using connection of my Github repo, but:
1. It only works with public repos
2. Max file size for file in repo is 25mb and my CSV files exceed this limit.

## Solution:
I will include all the neccessary files in Recruitee and you cab take a look at it at local host.
