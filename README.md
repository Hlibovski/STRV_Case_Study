# STRV_Case_Study
This project explores trends in baby names using data analysis and visualization. By leveraging historical name data, I identified popular names at the national and state levels, uncovered rare names, and examined naming patterns over time. The insights help parents make informed decisions when choosing a name while also providing valuable data-driven perspectives. The project utilizes Python, SQL, and Streamlit for interactive visualization, making name trends easily accessible and engaging.

## Project files:
1. STRV_Case_Study.pptx - presentation of the insights.
2. app.py - Python code of the old (not working Streamlit app).
3. app_parquet.py - Python code of the new (working Streamlit app).
4. STRV_Case_Study.docx - Word file documenting the thought process, ideas and ChatGPT brainstorming.
5. STRV_Case_Study.twb - Tableau visualizations (1st approach).
6. requirements.txt - list with all the libraries and versions.
7. CSV Files
8. Parquent Files

## Project Problem:
I wanted to host a streamlit app using connection of my Github repo, but : 
**Max file size for file in repo is 25mb and my CSV files exceed this limit.**

## Solution:
I will include all the neccessary files in Recruitee.
Files StateNames1960.csv and NatonalNames1960.csv are still too big, so **I have included txt file: "Google Drive Link", where I have put those a link on my Cloud Storage.**

## UPDATE: 
I have found a way around - just to **convert CSV files to Parquet.** 
I have created an app in Streamlit called app_parquet.py - where you can find all the interactive visualisations.
