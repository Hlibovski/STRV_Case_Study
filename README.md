# STRV_Case_Study
This project explores trends in baby names using data analysis and visualization. By leveraging historical name data, I identified popular names at the national and state levels, uncovered rare names, and examined naming patterns over time. The insights help parents make informed decisions when choosing a name while also providing valuable data-driven perspectives. The project utilizes Python, SQL, and Streamlit for interactive visualization, making name trends easily accessible and engaging.
